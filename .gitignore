# If you are not doing native edits, often good to ignore android/ios folders in Expo managed workflow, 
# but for a monorepo it's often better to keep them if ejected. 
# Since we are "blank" template (managed), we might not have them yet or they are generated (prebuild).
# For now, let's include them if they exist, but ignore build artifacts inside them.
